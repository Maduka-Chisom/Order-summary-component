## My process

- Read instructions
- Analyize design, observe document flow and element structure.
- Wrote the html code first
- Then applied styles in css
- Edited the README-template
- create repository and publish code on git
- submit assigment, share project and get feedback

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

learnt how to center a text, i actually could not for a while it was hilarious but finally figured it out. also learnt how to use the appropriate size for the UI development and i discovered that my browser has been zooming on my page which led to inconsitent sizing but its fixed now.

also i was keen about using semantic html

### Continued development

i intend on building more components, then webpages, websites using html, css and javascript and frontend tools.
